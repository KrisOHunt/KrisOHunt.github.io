        I was ready for my next career.

        Before becoming a stay-at-home mom, a position I thought I'd never
        have, my career was mostly centered in marketing. Starting by pasting
        up the classified section of a newspaper and ending up as the head
        marketer for a local theatre where I did everything from emails, season
        ticket brochures, posters, newletters, and postcards to dressing up in
        costume and lunching with the Chamber of Commerce. When you're working
        with a limited budget, get ready to wear a silly hat.

        After a 30 year career as a software engineer, Simon was ready to
        transition to his next stage in life. Call it his retirement career. He
        was ready to groom the next generation of clean coders by taking a
        position with the local community college.
